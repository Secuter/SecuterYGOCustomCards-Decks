## Decklists

For some archetypes, there isn't a pure version decklist if combining the deck with other archetypes makes it significantly stronger.<br>
Eg. playing the pure version of 'Primeval Forest' or 'Savage Beast' only increases the chances of bricking, or for archetypes like 'Irradiance' and 'Fog Dragon' that work too well together to be played separately.

I try to keep the decks updated with the latest cards released, both TCG/OCG ones and additions to my custom archetypes.<br>
However, when a banlist is released, not all decks may be immediately updated by removing the banned/limited cards if those affected cards were essential to the deck's strategy.

PS: Most of them still contains Baronne de Fleur and Borreload Savage Dragon.
