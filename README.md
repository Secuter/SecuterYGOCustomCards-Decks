#  Decks & Combo Replays
 
 
There are some replays marked as 'old', these have been rendered obsolete by the new cards that have come out, but I have left them to showcase a combo that was still valid at the time. For example, 'Dark King' with its new cards can perform the combo with greater consistency without playing 'Impcantation' cards.

Decks marked as 'banned,' on the other hand, are no longer viable because a card in the combo has been banned. For instance, 'True King of All Calamities' is now banned, so the 'Morhai' combo that Summons it is no longer valid.
